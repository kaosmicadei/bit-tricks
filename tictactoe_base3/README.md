TicTacToe encoded in a base-3 string.[^1]

The idea is to enconde game in a single number[^2], which here, will be constructed using base 3.

We start be numbering the cells in the board from 0 to 8. For the cell values we use 0 for "empty",
1 for "cross" and 2 for "circle". That way the number $`g`$ that describe the state of the game can
be generated by

```math
g = \sum_{n=0}^8 c_n 3^n \quad;\quad c_n=0,1,2 .
```

The advantage of this technique is that any configuration fits in less than 16 bits!

Take for instance the game state below.

|X||O|
|-|-|-|
||X||
|||O|

This configuration is represent by the number $`g`$,

```math
g = 1 + 2 \times 3^2 + 1 \times 3^4 + 2 \times 3^8 = 13222 .
```

To recover the value of a perticular cell, let's say cell 4, we first divide the state number by the
power of three related to the cell, $`3^4`$ in this case,

```math
g \div 3^4 = 1 + 2 \times 3^4 .
```

Here the $`\div`$ is being used to indicate integer division. 

Taking the `mod 3`  of the result isolate the linear term extracting the value of the cell,

```math
g \div 3^4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3  \implies c_4 = 1.
```

A new value $`v`$ can be set to a cell $`c`$ by subtracting the olde value and add the new one to
game state number,

```math 
g' = g + \big[v - \big(g \div 3^c \big) \,\%\, 3 \big] \times 3^c
```
